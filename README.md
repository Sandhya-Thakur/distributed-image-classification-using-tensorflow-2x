# Distributed TensorFlow Comparison
Comparing single GPU vs distributed TensorFlow training speed on CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Project Structure
- source_code/: Python scripts for training
- jupyter_notebooks/: Colab notebooks with experiments
- training_results/: Logs, plots, and performance metrics
- dataset/: CIFAR-10 data (auto-downloaded)

## Goal
Measure how much faster distributed training is compared to single GPU training.
